## 🎯 What Documentation Should Include

**In simplest terms:**

**Documentation** is all the information about your project:
- **What it does** (features)
- **How to use it** (instructions)
- **How to set it up** (installation)
- **How it works** (technical details)
- **What technologies it uses** (tech stack)
- **Screenshots** (visual proof)
- **Contact information** (support)

Think of documentation as an instruction manual. Someone who has never seen your project should be able to:
1. Understand what it does
2. Set it up on their computer
3. Use all features
4. Contact you for support
